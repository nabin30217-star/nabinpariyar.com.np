## About Page Content

### Bio
```
"I'm a self-taught developer from Nepal who fell in love with building things that people actually use. Six months ago, I wrote my first line of Kotlin — today I have three apps on the Google Play Store and I'm expanding into web development.

I believe great software should feel invisible: fast, intuitive, and reliable. Every day I'm learning, shipping, and getting better.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably exploring new technologies, reading documentation, or thinking about how to make apps that feel effortless to use."
```

Languages: Kotlin, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, XML
Frameworks: Jetpack Compose, Next.js, React
